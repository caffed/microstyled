## Getting started

- Please familiarize yourself with the source code of the project, including example projects listed in [examples](./examples).

- Read the roadmap listed in the [README.md](./README.md).

- Read the open [issues](https://github.com/caffed/microstyled/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+) to see if there is anything in progress addressing the feature or bug request you are interested in.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If the feature or bug is not listed in the [open issues](https://github.com/caffed/microstyled/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+) then create a new feature request or bug issue and follow the prompts.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through the [open issues](https://github.com/caffed/microstyled/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes locally

1. Clone the repo locally.

2. Fork off of the `main` branch.

3. Make your code change, with new tests if applicable, ensuring that `npm run lint` and `npm test` pass without modification of existing tests or code.

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. See [Atom's contributing guide](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#git-commit-messages) to know how to use emoji for commit messages.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Follow the instructions in the pull request template ensuring that you change `[ ]` to `[x]` when each item is complete.

### Your PR has been merged

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [README.md's](./README.md) `CONTRIBUTERS` section.
